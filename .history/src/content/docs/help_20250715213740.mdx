# Introduction

**nurui** is not just another React component library. It’s a modern approach to building UI components that puts you in full control whether you add them manually or generate them via our CLI.

Whether you're building a dashboard, SaaS product, or portfolio website, nurui offers flexibility through both CLI and manual integration.

## Why nurui?

Traditional UI libraries often work like this: you install a package, import components, and use them as-is. But what happens when you need to customize a component to fit your unique design system or add new functionality? Often, you end up writing workarounds, wrapping components, or mixing incompatible APIs — which slows you down and creates maintenance headaches.

nurui solves this by embracing **Open Code** and **Composition**:

- **Open Code** : You get the actual source code for each component, so you can easily modify, extend, or adapt it to your project’s needs without hacks or overrides.

- **Composition** : Every component shares a consistent, composable interface that makes building and scaling your UI intuitive and predictable.

We invite you to explore the library, customize the components to your liking, and build beautiful experiences that your users will love.

## Motivation

The inspiration for creating this component library came from my own needs as a web developer. Over the years, I’ve built many reactive and user-friendly websites, and noticed that certain components and animations were reused across projects. Searching through files to find these snippets became tedious and inefficient. I wanted a centralized place where all my components and animations could live — easy to access and reuse.

My confidence to build this library grew after exploring amazing projects like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com), [ui-layout](https://www.ui-layouts.com) and [Magic UI](https://magicui.design). Their openness and quality inspired me to create a free component library to share with the community.
